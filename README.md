### OS written using """no external software"""
Do you have trust issues to a stupid degree?  
Do you have several mental illnesses?  
Then this is for you!

## Disclaimer
Let's get this out of the way: it uses external software  
I know, I know, that's the whole point of the project. But as it stand right now, I am, in fact, using a hex editor to write code. Crazy, I know, but the hardware hex editor is coming later. As it stands now, these are the current problems:
- An OS to develop off of. I use arch, btw
- A hex editor. I use `hexedit`
- A virtual machine. Not technically required, but very nice. I use `qemu`
- git. obviously.

## What is "External Software"?
Everything, execept what's mentioned in the disclaimer
